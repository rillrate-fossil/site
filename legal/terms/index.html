<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and our Privacy Policy (“<strong>Agreements</strong>”). You acknowledge that you have read and understood Agreements, and agree to be bound of them.</p>
<p>If you do not agree with (or cannot comply with) Agreements, then you may not use the Service, but please let us know by emailing at <a href="mailto:support@rillrate.com">support@rillrate.com</a> so we can try to find a solution.

<p>Any contests, sweepstakes or other promotions (collectively, “<strong>Promotions</strong>”) made available through Service may be governed by rules that are separate from these Terms of Service. If you participate in any Promotions, please review the applicable rules as well as our Privacy Policy. If the rules for a Promotion conflict with these Terms of Service, Promotion rules will apply.</p>
<h3 id="5-subscriptions">5. Subscriptions</h3>
<p>Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis (“<strong>Subscription(s)</strong>”). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“<strong>Billing Cycle</strong>”). Billing cycles are set on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or RillRate OU cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting RillRate OU customer support team.</p>
<p>A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your subscription. You shall provide RillRate OU with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize RillRate OU to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
<p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, RillRate OU will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>

<p>If you do enter your billing information when signing up for Free Trial, you will not be charged by RillRate OU until Free Trial has expired. On the last day of Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.</p>
<p>At any time and without notice, RillRate OU reserves the right to (i) modify Terms of Service of Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>
<h3 id="7-fee-changes">7. Fee Changes</h3>
<p>RillRate OU, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
<p>RillRate OU will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
<p>Your continued use of Service after Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
